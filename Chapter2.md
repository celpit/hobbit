# Chapter 2

## Roast mutton

In chapter two, the group decides to stop for a rest only to find out that Gandalf is gone. They decide to set up a fire anyway but one of the dwarves drops their food supply in the river. Then they come upon a light belonging to the fire of three giants. Just when all hope is lost Gandalf appears and knocks over two trees making the light of dawn turn them to stone.
